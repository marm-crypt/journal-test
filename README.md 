# Simple Journal (React + Vite)

A very small web-first journaling app with two pages: Home and Dashboard. You can write an entry and select a mood. Entries are saved to your browser's localStorage.

## Run locally
1) Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

2) Start the dev server

```
npm run dev
```

Open the Local URL shown in the terminal (e.g., http://localhost:5173).

## Build for production
```
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## What’s included
- Home: form to add a journal entry + pick a mood (Great, Good, Okay, Bad, Awful) and a small recent list
- Dashboard: total entries, last 7 days count, mood breakdown, and a full entries list
- Local persistence: entries are stored under the key `journal_entries_v1` in localStorage

## Essential files to copy into VS Code
Copy only these and you’ll have a working app:
- package.json
- vite.config.js
- index.html
- main.jsx
- App.js
- styles.css
- pages/Home.jsx
- pages/Dashboard.jsx
- postcss.config.js
- tailwind.config.js
- .gitignore (optional)
- README.md (optional)

All other files in this workspace are unused and can be ignored.

## Notes
- No backend required. Everything runs fully in the browser.
- If your environment complains about a missing `react-router` module, run:
  `npm i react-router` (usually not needed—`react-router-dom` pulls it in).
